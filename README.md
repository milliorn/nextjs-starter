# Next.Js Starter

[![CodeQL](https://github.com/milliorn/nextjs-starter/actions/workflows/github-code-scanning/codeql/badge.svg)](https://github.com/milliorn/nextjs-starter/actions/workflows/github-code-scanning/codeql)

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app. It serves as a starter template for building Next.js applications with TypeScript and ESLint.

## Getting Started

To get started with this Next.js starter template, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the project dependencies by running the following command `npm install`
3. Start the development server by running the following command `npm run dev`

This will start the Next.js development server, and you can access your application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed at [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm run dev`: Starts the Next.js development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the Next.js application for production.
- `npm start`: Starts the Next.js production server.
- `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to lint the source code.

## Dependencies

The Next.Js Starter project relies on the following dependencies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Typed superset of JavaScript.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): Pluggable JavaScript linter.

For a complete list of dependencies, refer to the `package.json` file.
